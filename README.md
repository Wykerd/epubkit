# EPUBKit

EPUBKit is a TypeScript library for rendering EPUB files in the browser. 

## State

**This project is in the early stages of development. It is not yet ready for use.**

The whole repository will undergo major refactoring and restructuring in the near future. Currently it is merely a vite project with the library in a directory called `src/lib`.

## Goal

This project aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use library for rendering EPUB files in the browser. It is intended to be used in web applications that need to display EPUB files.

This library aims to implement the W3C's [EPUB Reading Systems 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33).
